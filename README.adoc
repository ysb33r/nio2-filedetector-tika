= Java NIO2 FIle Type Detection Provider

This is a simple wrapper for https://tika.apache.org/[Apache Tika] that allows the
`Files.probeContentType(Path)` from NIO2 to be used in real code and actually be useful.

== Mavan Coordinates

*Maven group*: `org.ysb33r.nio`

*Artifact id*: `nio2-filetypedetector-tika`

*Version*: Please check *** for the latest published version

JDK7+

== Usage

Nothing much is required. Just ensure the JAR is on the classpath and it will automatically be loaded by NIO2.

The `tika-filetypedector-groovy` and `tika-filetypedector-kotlin` directories are left as examples of how to implement
a `FileTypeDetector` in both Groovy & Kotlin. Their artifacts, however, are not published to Bintray.
